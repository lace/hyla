2D and 3D computational geometry library.

The goal of this library is to provide lightweight (and eventually fast)
implementations of primitives like planes, polygonal chains, and axis-aligned
bounding boxes, along with geometric operations.

Counterpart to the Python library [polliwog][].

**This project is experimental!**

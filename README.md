Immutable 2D and 3D computational geometry library in TypeScript.

The goal of this library is to provide lightweight implementations of primitives
like planes, polygonal chains, and axis-aligned bounding boxes, along with
geometric operations.

It aims to be efficient and avoid unnecessary copies. So far there have been no
attempts to replace loops with vectorized operations, though this may be done in
the future.

Counterpart to the Python library [polliwog][].

**This project is experimental!**
